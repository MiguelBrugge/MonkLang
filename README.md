# About
I created MonkLang to improve my React skills while also providing a useful tool for language learners. With MonkLang, you can easily practice translating words from one language to another. The application features a user-friendly interface where you can enter words in one language on the left field and their translations in the other on the right field.

# Features
**MonkLang offers the following features:**

- Bidirectional Practice: You can practice translating words from one language to another in both directions. This allows you to strengthen your vocabulary and comprehension skills in both languages.

- Save and Load: MonkLang allows you to save your word pairs as a JSON file, making it easy to import and export your vocabulary. By saving your progress, you can revisit and practice the same words again at any time without having to re-enter them.

- Custom File Naming: When exporting your word pairs as a JSON file, you can choose a custom file name. This makes it convenient to organize and identify different sets of vocabulary.

# Help
**Translate words**
- This application is intended to aid you in practicing translation skills between languages. To begin, input the original word and its translation in the designated text field, then click "start" to begin the quiz. The application will generate practice questions for you to translate words, so continue practicing until you feel confident in your ability to accurately translate between the languages.

**Saving**
- The application has a great feature that allows you to save your words as a JSON file. By doing so, you can practice them later without having to input them repeatedly.

**Tip:**
- To get the right promt ask an AI like ChatGPT this: Can you provide me with 30 English words and their corresponding Dutch translations? Please ensure that both lists are arranged in the same order. The first list should contain the English words, and the second list should contain their Dutch translations.
